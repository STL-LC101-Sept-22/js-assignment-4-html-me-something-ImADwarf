               <h2>1. It's Really Big</h2>
               <p>The universe is thought to be about 93 billion light-years in diameter! Since our minds cannot comprehend a distance that enormous, we can break it down by saying space is at least eight car-widths across. Pretty neat, huh?</p>

               <h2>2. It is Accelerating Outward!</h2>
               <p>Despite the universe having a center of mass that should pull everything inward due to gravity, science has observed the opposite! The universe is expanding outward at an increasing rate, as if pushed or pulled by some unknown force! One leading theory is that this is caused by invisible dark matter that has different laws and attributes than known mass. I don't know about you, but that makes me a little uncomfy!</p>

               <h2>3. Matter "Knows" if it's Being Observed!</h2>
               <p>That's right! Research into quantum mechanics has revealed that mass on a subatomic level behaves differently when it is being observed or measured! More specifically, mass particles exhibit the properties of waves when unobserved. This means that mass particles are able to break some of the laws that typically govern them. So if a tree falls in the forest when nobody is there to observe it, it may not make a sound at all!</p>
